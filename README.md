**# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition-with-TensorFlow**

This project is focused on building a deep learning model for classifying emotions in tweets. 
Using a dataset of labeled tweets, the goal is to predict the emotional tone of a tweet based on its content. 
Emotions like "sadness", "joy", "anger", etc., are predicted using an LSTM-based model with bidirectional layers for better performance in text classification tasks.

**# Project Overview**

This project aims to predict the emotion expressed in tweets. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and
it uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with bidirectional layers to classify the emotion. 
The data is preprocessed, tokenized, and padded to feed into the LSTM network for training and evaluation.

**# Emotions Predicted:**

Sadness

Joy

Love

Anger

Fear

Surprise

**Features**

**Data Preprocessing:** Tokenizes tweets, handles missing values, and pads sequences for LSTM input.

**Model Architecture:** LSTM-based model with bidirectional layers.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.

**Visualization:** Plots training and validation accuracy/loss, confusion matrix
